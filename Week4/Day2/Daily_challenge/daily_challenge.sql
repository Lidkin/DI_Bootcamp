-- Q1: 
-- my_answer: 2
-- right_answer: 0 - It will be 0 because we are doing NOT IN in NOTHING

-- Q2:
-- my_ansver: 2 - It will be 2 ( counted: 6 'Sharlee' and 7, 'Krish' and didn't count 'Avtaar' because his id is null )
--right_answer: 2

-- Q3:
-- my_ansver: 2
--right_answer: 0 - It will be 0 because SELECT id FROM SecondTab return (5, null) and NOT IN can't take id = null
